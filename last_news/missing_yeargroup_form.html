    <h2>📨 Form for Students Without Year Group Email</h2>
    <p><em>Published By: IT Team</em></p>
    <p><em>Published: 10 July 2025</em></p>

    <p>At Elfed High School, we want to ensure that all students have access to important information and resources. One way we do this is through year group email accounts, which are used to send out key messages and updates.</p>
    <p>Some students may not have access to their designated year group email accounts. To help staff report and resolve this issue, please use the form provided below.</p>

    <p><strong>Use this form if a student:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does not have access to their year group email</li>
      <li>Is new and has not been assigned an email yet</li>
      <li>Has reported missing year group messages</li>
    </ul>
