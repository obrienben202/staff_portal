    <h2>Term 2 ILPs – Teacher Comments Required</h2>
    <p><em>Published By: Wellbeing Team</em></p>
    <p><em>Published: 12 January 2026</em></p>

    <p> As we approach the end of Term 2, all teaching staff are required to complete their <strong>Individual Learning Plan (ILP) Teacher Comments</strong> for their students.
    These comments form an essential part of our reporting process and support clear communication with parents and carers. </p>

    <p><strong>Please ensure you complete the following:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Review each student’s ILP goals for Term 2</li>
    <li>Write clear, personalised, parent-friendly comments</li>
    <li>Highlight progress, strengths, and next steps</li>
    <li>Check spelling, grammar, and clarity before submission</li>
    <li>Ensure comments are entered into the correct ILP system/template</li>
  </ul>

    <p><strong>Google Sheet for ILP Comments:</strong></p>
  <p>
    All completed ILP comments must also be entered into the shared tracking sheet below so the Wellbeing Team can review and provide support where needed.</p>
